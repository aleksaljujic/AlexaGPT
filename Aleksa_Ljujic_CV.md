# Aleksa Ljujić – CV

## [ABOUT ME]

Fourth-year student in Information Systems and Technologies with a strong orientation toward applied artificial intelligence and intelligent
systems. My background combines machine learning, data engineering, and software engineering, with a focus on turning data and models into
working, end-to-end solutions. Through academic and practical projects, I have worked across the full lifecycle of AI-driven systems from data
modeling and analytics, through model development, to integration into web, client-server, and enterprise environments. This has allowed me
to develop a system-level understanding of how AI components interact with databases, APIs, and user-facing applications. I am currently
specializing further in applied AI, aiming to build scalable and reliable systems where machine learning is not an isolated component, but a core
part of real-world software
